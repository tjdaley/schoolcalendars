Compare School Calendars

This utility permits the subscriber to select multiple school calendars to create a unified view of the combined academic year.

## Architecture

The school calendars are saved in a data store, indexed by ISD sub-calendar within ISD.

The styles are in a styles table and are named for the categories of dates that appear in the calendar.

## UI

Users login in, and select the state and counties of the school districts. From there, a filtered list of school districts appears. The user then selects the school districts to compare and a calendar is shown in the browser.

Or

What if we show the calendar and let the user add school districts? That could be more gratifying.
